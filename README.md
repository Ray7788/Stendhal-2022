Latest Update:
===
* Florence will make fish soup if the player bring all the required ingredients. She even has an option to take all of the required ingredients from a single prompt:
```
Welcome back! I hope you collected some #ingredients for the fish soup, or #everything
```

* A disguise feature that allows the player to dress in the same uniform as certain kinds of enemy mob, and then walk unattacked in areas where those mobs are patrolling.
Players would need somewhere to buy the armour from (maybe that guy who sells stuff in Ados Barracks?) and would then put it on and have their costume change, so they at least resemble the enemy mobs they are disguising as.
When wearing the disguise, players can walk in certain areas (perhaps hard coded for now) without the enemy mobs seeing them and rushing to attack them.  It would be like being invisible in admin mode.
But there would always be a chance of being recognised as an interloper by some nearby mob, in which case the mob would give a cry of "attack!" or something, and the player would no longer be invisible. The more armor you are wearing of the right kind, the lower the probability that you are detected.

Maybe some costumes would need more than just armor - like the elf one, which might need fake ears and a dress or robe or something rather than armor.  These would be bought from other NPCs, picked to suit whatever mob is being impersonated.

This would be a fun feature, and would allow weaker players the chance to explore some harder areas, making the game more interesting for new players and helping keep them coming back to play some more.
